                About:
                eBay is a multinational e-commerce corporation based in San Jose, California that facilitates consumer-to-consumer and business-to-consumer sales through its website.
                eBay is an online auction and shopping website in which people and businesses buy and sell a wide variety of products and services domestically and internationally.
                The website is free to use for buyers, but sellers are charged fees for listing items after a limited number of free listings, having different features, and when those items are sold ebay takes a certain percentage of commission.

                Reviews/Ratings:
                eBay allows buyers to rate and review the sellers based on their experience with them by using stars and in the following four categories: <em>Item as described</em>; <em>Shipping Time</em>; <em>Shipping and Handling Charges</em>; <em>Communication</em>.
                eBay tends to focus a lot more on the reviews and ratings of the seller then the product itself.
                Reviews are associated with a specific product, ensuring a reliable and consistent user experience for buyers. 
                Reviews written by eBay buyers have the added benefit of having the sellerâ€™s username associated with the review.

                Examples of reviews:
                <!-- Images of reviews and ratings will go here and will need resizing to ensure it aligns on the page well-->
                <!-- Might need description with the images -->
