            About:

            Reviews/Ratings:
            eBay allows buyers to rate and review the sellers based on their experience with them by using stars and in the following four categories: <em>Item as described</em>; <em>Shipping Time</em>; <em>Shipping and Handling Charges</em>; <em>Communication</em>.
            eBay tends to focus a lot more on the reviews and ratings of the seller then the product itself.
            Reviews are associated with a specific product, ensuring a reliable and consistent user experience for buyers. 
            Reviews written by eBay buyers have the added benefit of having the sellerâ€™s username associated with the review.

            Examples of reviews:
            <!-- Images of reviews and ratings will go here and will need resizing to ensure it aligns on the page well-->
            <!-- Might need description with the images -->
