                About:
                Google Shopping (formerly known as Google Products, Google Product Search) allows users to search for products on online shopping websites and compare prices between different vendors.
                Unlike the other two sites Google Shopping is used more to compare the prices of a product among different vendors and it allows the consumers to be able to compare them all on the same page.        
            </p>
            <p>
                Reviews/Ratings:
                Google allows the users to rate and review the products and since it is Google it has the same user interface as any other Google reviews.
                Product ratings are shown as 1 to 5 star rating system and a count of total reviews.
                These star ratings represent cumulative rating and review data for the product, compiled from multiple sources including merchants, third-party reviews aggregators, editorial sites and consumers.
                Google also shows the ratings of the vendors that's selling the products along with the prices of the product that the vendors have them listed under.         
            </p>

                Examples of reviews:
                <!-- Images of reviews and ratings will go here and will need resizing to ensure it aligns on the page well-->
                <!-- Might need description with the images -->  
            </p>
